'''
navigation.py - Drives the rover on a mission using RC_OVERRIDES. Currently runs as it's own script.
                I would like to turn it into a library and thread it. It is very stupid and will CRASH
                the rover if the user interferes at all. IT SHOULD ONLY BE USED IN SITL

parameters  - mission file : currently thunderhill.mission

note    - add this line "thunderhill=39.53901277,-122.33117926,25,180" to ardupilot/Tool/autotest/locations.txt
        and launch SITL using "sim_vehicle.sh -L thunderhill" in order to launch sitl at thunderhill
        - the mission file can be modified using qgroundcontrol
